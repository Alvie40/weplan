      <h2>GETTING TO CROATIA</h2>
      <p>
        Being a popular summer tourist destination, getting to Croatia is
        relatively easy. The closest major city to Hvar is&nbsp;
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/a8JeWAEuugN2">Split</a> and it is fairly
        well connected by pretty much all European airlines and some low-cost
        carriers, such as&nbsp;
        <a href="https://wizzair.com/#/booking/select-flight/LTN/SPU/2017-08-22/2017-09-02/1/0/0">
          WizzAir
        </a>{" "}
        and&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.eurowings.com/en.html">Eurowings</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second closest major airport is in{" "}
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/goc5oZWa3wC2">Dubrovnik</a>. It is about 5
        hours away from Hvar via a ferry, which is kind of far, but if you are
        planning on doing some touring before or after the wedding it is a great
        location to visit. Have a look at the 'Things to do section' further
        down for more information on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of the time of writing there are no&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.kayak.com/flights/NYC-SPU/2017-08-25/2017-09-02/2adults">
          direct flights
        </a>
        &nbsp; from the US or Canada to Croatia, so guests coming from there
        will have to do at least one connection in a major European hub such as
        Frankfurt, Zurich or Amsterdam.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2>FERRY TO THE ISLAND OF HVAR</h2>
      <p>
        The Split airport is located about 25km (16mi) from the harbour from
        where the ferries leave for Hvar. According to the bus company's{" "}
        <a href="http://www.buscroatia.com/airport-split/">website</a> a taxi
        should cost about 35 EUR/40 USD for 1-3 people while the bus costs
        around 4 EUR/5 USD per person. Unless you are in a real hurry to catch a
        ferry, we recommend taking the bus. They are big white coaches just a
        few steps to the left after you exit though the main airport entrance
        and we found them to be very comfortable and convenient. They accept
        both cash and credit card for payment.
      </p>

      <div id="gmap">
        <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1QdPbr1DgM7Cgiw2PwAbLgpINiSI"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>
        The bus or taxi will drop you off at the Split bus station, which is on
        the water. The bus drop-off is only 5 minutes walk from the ferry ticket
        kiosk. There you can buy tickets or ask for the terminal from which your
        ferry leaves if it is unclear from the large electronic panel infront of
        it, listing the departures. The ferry ticket kiosk looks like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          className="large-image"
          src={require("./img/split-ferry-ticket-kiosk.jpg")}
          alt="Ferry tickets kiosk"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you are at the seaport and looking for transportation to the
        island, please note that there are two landing spots on the island -
        Hvar Town and the Old Town (Stari Grad). The wedding will be in Hvar
        Town, which is in the south-west end of the island, not in the Old Town,
        which is on the nortern end. Please make sure you are boarding the right
        ferry, but even if you make a mistake, stay calm because there is a very
        convenient bus between the two. As a rule, the car ferries go to Old
        Town (Stari Grad) and take about 2 hours to travel and the fast
        passenger ferries (catamaran) go directly to Hvar Town and take 1 hour.
      </p>

      <div id="gmap">
        <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1H0mc9QKj_OwW1TZCWtQc_tb3s9k"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>
        There are two ferry companies which serve the route from Split to Hvar -
        Jadrolinija and Kapetan Luka. Below we have information for each of
        them.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <a href="http://www.jadrolinija.hr/en/ferry-croatia">Jadrolinija</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a high-speed catamaran service from Split to Hvar Town which
        takes about 65 min. This is the fastest option and costs around 10
        EUR/11 USD per person. If you have a car, this site also contains the
        schedule and pricing for the ferries, which transport cars to the
        island.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>
        <a href="http://www.krilo.hr/en/index.html">Kapetan Luka</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is the regular ferry service which takes about 2.5 hours and should
        cost around 5-10 EUR/6-11 USD per person.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.atlantis-marine.net/en/croatia-boat-transfers">
          Chartered Speed Boat
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you are coming as a group or feel like a one percenter, this site has
        information for inclusive transportation packages with pickup from the
        airport. The sailing part of the journey takes between 45 min to 1 hour,
        which is similar to the catamaran service, but is a little bit more
        convenient because it also includes a pickup from the airport. If you
        choose this option, there is a 5% discount using{" "}

      <h2>DRIVING</h2>
      <p>
        For those renting a car or driving to Croatia, we found the driving
        conditions on the island to be good and there is a parking spot right in
        the center of the town for 1 EUR/hour or 12 EUR/day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that unless you are coming by car to the island of Hvar,
        there should not be a need for you to rent one. There are many organized
        boat trips to discover the surrounding Dalmatian islands and cabrio cars
        can be rented daily at a fairly decent price from Hvar itself and the
        paperwork is not that much. For example we rented this funny car for
        about 60 USD for a day trip:
      </p>
      <p>

          alt="Day car rental"
        />
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>ACCOMMODATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        Once on the island in Hvar Town there are various accommodation options
        ranging from fancy hotels to renting an apartment on{" "}
        <a href="https://goo.gl/uHTDYn">AirBnB</a>. The wedding will be in the
        Amfora Resort so any accommodation within walking distance from there
        should be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        From our research we have found that hotels are fairly expensive and
        there are very nice AirBnB options available, so we highly recommend
        doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
        For guests wishing to stay in a hotel, the{" "}
        <a href="http://www.suncanihvar.com/">Suncani Hvar</a> chain of hotels
        offers a 20% discount using{" "}
        <SecretTooltip
          fnTooltip={() => {
            return "WEDDKALOIANJOCELYN";
          }}
        >
          this code
        </SecretTooltip>{" "}
        (please click on the 'this' in order to show it). The code must be
        entered in the <i>"Corporate/Promo Code ?"</i> section for the
        discounted prices to apply and is valid for staying 5 days prior and 5
        days after the wedding day. While this code indeed reduces the listed
        prices, we have found that booking through{" "}
        <a href="https://goo.gl/2xzaIg">Expedia</a> or{" "}
        <a href="https://goo.gl/z6zsZk">Hotels.com</a>&nbsp; shows about the
        same prices or in some cases even cheaper, so please bear that in mind
        as well.

        Since all of you are coming from different parts of the world, we
        presume that you would like to make a full vacation out of your trip to
        Croatia. In this section we are listing some of the main tourist places

      </p>
      <p>
        Located in the very south of the country, Dubrovnik was once called the
        "Pearl of the Adriatic" for its architecture and importance in trade. We
        won't pretend that we know much about its history, but it is a place
        which must be visited and is also a convenient location to fly into and
        work your way up the coast to Hvar. On top of that, for the 'Game of
        Thrones' fans, quite a few scenes from this show were filmed in
        Dubrovnik. See&nbsp;

        Split. If you find good flights to Zagreb, Plitvice Lakes can serve as a
